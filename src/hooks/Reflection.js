                ENGL 202C has forced me out of my comfort zone to make me a more professional writer. Before this course, English
                courses usually entailed writing papers about abstract analyses of literature. However, this course put my writing
                abilities to the test. I have never had to focus on my written communication within my field of computer science. Computer science
                courses only require me to solve math problems or write code usually. Writing descriptive papers about select topics in computer science
                helped me focus on how I can effectively communicate my technical knowledge to various audiences. I was able to hone my skills
                in addressing expert audiences within my field as well as those audiences without experience in my field. This ability to write to various
                audiences will undoubtedly help me for the rest of my career.

              <div className="h5-responsive mb-4">
                I chose to include my Executive Summary assignment because I demonstrate that I can read and comprehend advanced research
                papers in computer science as well as provide my own synthesis of these papers. This assignment in particular emphasizes
                my ability to communicate professionally and effectively to experts within my domain.

              <div className="h5-responsive mb-4">
                I include my Technical Description to demonstrate my ability to convey advanced knowledge to people within my field that may not
                know this information yet. This assignment allowed me to explain an advanced topic in machine learning to an audience that has
                proper experience in mathematics and computer science, but not specifically with machine learning. Therefore, in a sense, this technical
                description proves that I am able to "teach" a specific topic to people within the area of computer science.

                The Instruction Set shows my communication skills relating to writing for various audiences. This instruction set can appeal to both
                experts and novices alike. My instructions often further explain the technical details of many of the steps, which an expert would
                take interest in. However, for a novice who may not understand some of the technical details, the instructions can still be followed
                correctly and easily.

              <div className="h5-responsive mb-4">
                I also chose to include my final project from an Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course. This project demonstrates
                my ability to write professional reports about research experiments within my field. Although this was just a small final project with
                a rather simple experiment, the report highlights many of my skills in writing professionally. I also enjoyed this project very much
                because sudoku puzzles are fun (even though solving them programmatically eliminates the fun)!
              </div>    

              <div className="h5-responsive mb-4">
                I believe that this course and its projects have made me a stronger candidate for jobs following my graduation. Many technology companies
                will receive hundreds or thousands of applicants with similar credentials: knowing plenty of programming languages and taking generally the 
                same courses. However, not every candidate will be able to demonstrate strong communication and writing skills. One can also argue
                that communication is more important than most technical knowledge because many technical skills (e.g. learning a new programming language)
                can be learned on-the-job rather quickly. Teaching effective writing skills is something that cannot be learned so quickly and easily though.
                For this reason, I am grateful that this course has allowed me to focus on a skill that is often taken for granted in my field. Hopefully
                my improved technical writing skills will allow me to thrive in my career.
